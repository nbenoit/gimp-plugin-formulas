	FAQ Of The Formulas Rendering Plugin release 0.9.8
------------------------------------------------------


* Why did you write such a useless plugin?
 Well, it's was very challenging for me to write a maths interpretor.
 I also really enjoy typing random formulas and see what's happening.


* I upgraded from 0.9.0 or older and I don't see any difference?!
 The name of the binary has changed from the 0.8.0 to the 0.9.0
 and from the 0.9.0 to the 0.9.4... I am sorry about that.
 Just remove the old binary:
   rm ~/.gimp-2.0/plug-ins/gimp-plugin-formula*
  or
   rm /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/gimp-plugin-formula*
  or 
   rm /usr/local/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/gimp-plugin-formula*


* Can I share this plugin with my friends?
 Yes of course! This plugin is released under the GNU-GPL License.
 See COPYING for more details.


* I have some ideas about improving your plugin, what should I do?
 Well, just write an email to nbenoit@tuxfamily.org


* I can do some translations and write some documentation...
 Well, just write an email to nbenoit@tuxfamily.org


* Why is the plugin so slow?
 I suppose this comes from the code itself...
 Sorry, I'll try to improve the speed.


* Is this plugin compatible with the GIMP 2.2 and later ?
 Yes it is.
