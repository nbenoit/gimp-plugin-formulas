	Formulas Rendering Plugin release 0.9.8

These are the release notes for the Formulas Rendering Plugin version 0.9.8
Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all about.


WHAT IS THE FORMULAS RENDERING PLUGIN ?

 This plugin has been developped for my own usage. However, I think it's
 a funny plugin and the code might interest someone...
 Please, don't blame me for the poor quality of the code; I try to write
 clean and bugfree code; but sometimes, I might have stupid ideas...
 Write me if you have any suggestion, request, critic or patch...


HOW TO INSTALL?

 Read the file INSTALL in order to get the answer of this question... ;)


HOW TO UPGRADE?
 If you're upgrading from 0.9.0 or older, you'll have to remove the old
 plugin binary because the name has changed.
 Try this:
   rm ~/.gimp-2.?/plug-ins/gimp-plugin-formula*
  or
   rm /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/gimp-plugin-formula*
  or 
   rm /usr/local/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/gimp-plugin-formula*


HOW TO RUN?

 Once you have compiled & installed,you should be able to run the program
 from the GIMP Filters->Render Menu.
 Please read the FAQ if you have any problem or suggestion.


DON'T YOU HAVE ANY EXAMPLES?

 You may try following formulas:

  1)
  Red Channel:    ((1+cos(rad(x+y)))*127)+1
  Green Channel:  ((1+sin(rad(x+y)))*127)+1
  Blue Channel:   y%255

  2)
  Red Channel:   sqrt((rgb(x+1,y-1)+2*rgb(x+1,y)+rgb(x+1,y+1)-rgb(x-1,y-1)-2*rgb(x-1,y)-rgb(x-1,y+1))^2+((rgb(x-1,y+1)+2*rgb(x,y+1)+rgb(x+1,y+1)-rgb(x-1,y-1)-2*rgb(x-1,y)-rgb(x-1,y+1))^2))*(255/1442.5)
  Green Channel: sqrt((rgb(x+1,y-1)+2*rgb(x+1,y)+rgb(x+1,y+1)-rgb(x-1,y-1)-2*rgb(x-1,y)-rgb(x-1,y+1))^2+((rgb(x-1,y+1)+2*rgb(x,y+1)+rgb(x+1,y+1)-rgb(x-1,y-1)-2*rgb(x-1,y)-rgb(x-1,y+1))^2))*(255/1442.5)
  Blue Channel:  sqrt((rgb(x+1,y-1)+2*rgb(x+1,y)+rgb(x+1,y+1)-rgb(x-1,y-1)-2*rgb(x-1,y)-rgb(x-1,y+1))^2+((rgb(x-1,y+1)+2*rgb(x,y+1)+rgb(x+1,y+1)-rgb(x-1,y-1)-2*rgb(x-1,y)-rgb(x-1,y+1))^2))*(255/1442.5)

  This is the inlined formula of the Sobel edge detection filter.


  3)
  First Pass:
     Red Channel:   0
     Green Channel: (1+cos(rad(x)))*127
     Blue Channel:  (1+cos(rad(y)))*127
  Second Pass:
    Red Channel:    192-((green(x,y)+blue(x,y))/3)
    Green Channel:  green(x,y)
    Blue Channel:   blue(x,y)

  4)
  Red Channel:      100
  Green Channel:    (1+cos(rad(x*2.21*x/(y+1))))*92
  Blue Channel:     (1+sin(rad(x*2.21*x/(y+1))))*127

 Yeah I know... It's ugly...
